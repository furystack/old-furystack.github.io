        The HTTP API is responsible for starting a HTTP (or HTTPS) listener,
        catch incoming requests and execute custom actions based on the
        predefined routing strategies. It comes with built-in authentication
        (cookie-based and basic at the moment). <br />
        The configuration is similar to other layers, it works with a few
        extension methods on the Injector instance.{" "}
        <CodeSnippet>.useHttpApi()</CodeSnippet> is for basic configuration,{" "}
        <CodeSnippet>.useHttpAuthentication()</CodeSnippet> is for
        authentication setup and <CodeSnippet>.listenHttp()</CodeSnippet> will
        start a listener. You can check the{" "}
        <InternalLink to="/getting-started">Getting Started Guide</InternalLink>{" "}
        for a simple configuration example.
