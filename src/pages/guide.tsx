        This little guide will hopefully help you to understand what FuryStack
        is (and what is not...), explain the core concepts of the APIs and the
        packages, why is it soo coool, opens up your third eye and helps your
        soul's salvation. <br /> There is no silver bullet so don't take it too
        seriously &nbsp; ðŸ–¤

        is a simple but powerful tool that you can use in NodeJs and in the
        browser. An extendable fluent API is also attached to injectors - you
        can configure almost your whole stack with it. &nbsp;

      <Subheader href="/guide/data-stores/">Data Stores ðŸ“¦</Subheader>
      <TextBody>
        Where should you store your data? SQL, NOSQL, InMemory or on a sticky
        note on the back of your pillow? In FuryStack, there is an ultimate
        answer: <i>it depends</i>ðŸ˜‰. You can choose between MongoDB, TypeORM,
        Redis, in a file system and for plain in-memory store - or you can
        implement your own PhysicalStore - it won't be so hard. You can also use
        multiple store types per app. &nbsp;

      <Subheader href="/guide/repository">Repository ðŸ§¬</Subheader>
      <TextBody>
        A Repository is the next layer above the data stores. When setting up a
        repository, you can create <i>DataSets</i> that can use a previously
        configured physical store. The difference is that while PhysicalStore
        focuses on the data, DataSet focuses on business logic. You can
        authorize, check permissions, subscribe to entity changes, etc... &nbsp;

      <Subheader href="/guide/http-api">Http API ðŸ•¸</Subheader>
      <TextBody>
        You can work with data, you can implement some business logic, it's time
        to communicate with the rest of the world. The straightforward answer is
        HTTP, so let's make some custom actions, configure routing and take a
        look at the built-in HTTP authentication. &nbsp;
